/**
 * Here's the place where the magic happens.
 * A web app with only one page doesn't seem to need a router, but I wanted to include it.
 * First, because it was one of the topics during the interview.
 * Second, because it will be useful as languages selector, so if we want someone to have same options,
 * we just need to send the link, and voila, same languages will be selected.
 * It could be used with other options as a select for the translations to download if we had pagination
 * or other texts selection.
 *
 * So, changing the page will call changeLanguages in translationStore, and this will load everything for us.
 * VoilÃ ! AUTOMAGIC
